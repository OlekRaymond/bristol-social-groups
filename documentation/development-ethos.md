# Development ethos

This site is intended as a community volunteering project to help people in Bristol discover social groups.

The site does not use any cookies or trackers, and no analytics scripts. Note that by hosting on Cloudflare Pages, some anonymous usage statistics of pages served are collected.

The site does not accept sponsorship or advertising of specific groups over others, however groups which meet more of the aims of the site may be listed higher or added to the site earlier.

No guarantee is made for the accuracy of data or for the long term maintenance of the site. All information is provided as is.

I've included direct links to the groups that host the events, so you can access the latest information about the event and contact the organizers yourself if you have further questions. These links should hopefully boost the search rankings of the individual groups and help them grow.

To reduce carbon emissions and ensure a speedy loading experience, use of images or heavyweight JavaScript is avoided where possible. The OpenStreetMap map widget loads map tile images which are somewhat weighty - this component is only loaded when the user views it, and not bundled within all pages.
