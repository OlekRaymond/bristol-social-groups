# Groups to add

https://www.southbristolchess.com/

Another meetup group - note that they list plenty of events as part of their description. https://www.meetup.com/bristol-board-games-meetup/?eventOrigin=event_home_page

- https://www.cliftonrunningclub.com/crcsessions - some of these sessions don't require any cost to join, according to instagram. How do we handle showing this as distinct to the main subscription? Include a note saying additional sessions are available, as part of the main group subscription.

https://www.clickbristol.co.uk/membership - A paid membership for discounts to events, whose price range is quite large depending on the events they host. It would be nice to just show a rough price range per event in the description then?

https://www.bristolindependentgaming.co.uk/ - a wide variety of events, some of which are regular.

https://www.instagram.com/goodgym/ - also different pricing?

## What about groups that aren't as easy to join?

There are some groups that are very social and good ways to make friends, but they aren't drop in / drop out & require experience, e.g. dramatic productions hosted by...

Bristol Musical Theatre (BMT), Bristol Musical Comedy Club (BMCC), Bristol Amateur Operatic Society (BAOS) and BLOC Productions (requiring auditions to take part in productions)
