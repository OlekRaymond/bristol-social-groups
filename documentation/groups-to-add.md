Review the groups listed in the following Local Voice magazine archive: https://issuu.com/keynshamvoice/

Women's Craft workshops at the Arnolfini, free, fridays 11am to 1pm

Writing meetup group - https://www.meetup.com/bristol-writing-meetup-group/

£10 monthly repair workshop - https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lived-loved-monthly-repair-workshop-bristol-tickets-799888777867?aff=ebdsoporgprofile

Westbury Harriers - Mix of social / competitive runs - https://groups.runtogether.co.uk/WestburyHarriersRunningClub/Runs

A monthly subscription service to access social events as part of an umbrella group - https://www.socialheroesadventureclub.co.uk/ - this may not quite align with the low / no cost as the monthly membership fee is £22, however if this allows access to multiple events it might be worthwhile. Needs some research

Lots of dancing groups!
