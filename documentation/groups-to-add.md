# Groups to add

Board game social group - https://www.meetup.com/board-game-social/

https://www.socialheroesadventureclub.co.uk/ - requires adding support for "Monthly recurring membership cost", like the Dickens Society requires an annual membership fee display...

- https://www.cliftonrunningclub.com/crcsessions - some of these sessions don't require any cost to join, according to instagram... ? How do we handle showing this as distinct to the main subscription...

https://www.clickbristol.co.uk/membership - A paid membership for discounts to events, whose price range is quite large depending on the events they host. It would be nice to just show a rough price range per event in the description then?

https://www.instagram.com/goodgym/ - also different pricing?

Westbury Harriers - Mix of social / competitive runs - https://groups.runtogether.co.uk/WestburyHarriersRunningClub/Runs

A monthly subscription service to access social events as part of an umbrella group - https://www.socialheroesadventureclub.co.uk/ - this may not quite align with the low / no cost as the monthly membership fee is £22, however if this allows access to multiple events it might be worthwhile. Needs some research

- Lots of dancing groups!
- Lots of language classes!
