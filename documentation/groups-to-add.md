# Groups to add

The following is a list of groups still to be added to the site.

---

Board games with https://northstreetgames.com/ - many weekly events run by this group at low cost, high priority to add

Board game social group - https://www.meetup.com/board-game-social/

ANimation screening and sharing meetup - https://www.instagram.com/animinspo_bristol/

Writing meetup group - https://www.meetup.com/bristol-writing-meetup-group/

£10 monthly repair workshop - https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/lived-loved-monthly-repair-workshop-bristol-tickets-799888777867?aff=ebdsoporgprofile

Westbury Harriers - Mix of social / competitive runs - https://groups.runtogether.co.uk/WestburyHarriersRunningClub/Runs

A monthly subscription service to access social events as part of an umbrella group - https://www.socialheroesadventureclub.co.uk/ - this may not quite align with the low / no cost as the monthly membership fee is £22, however if this allows access to multiple events it might be worthwhile. Needs some research

Lots of dancing groups

Lots of life drawing events - how social are these events however? Are they a good fit for this site?

Bristol Mind https://bristolmind.org.uk/support_type/community-social-activities/

## Vetoed groups

Generic fitness / yoga classes where the group doesn't hang out for a chat afterwards
