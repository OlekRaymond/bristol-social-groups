  "description": "This meetup is set up for language learners, interested in practising either their Spanish or their English (or both), while socialising and having a good time by chatting with like-minded people. At the events there are no hard rules, but participants are encouraged to switch regularly between English and Spanish so everyone has a chance to practise. Weekly events at various locations in Bristol.",
