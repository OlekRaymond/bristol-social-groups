With the help of our host you will be able to find other people attending the event with compatible language interests - we are all very friendly and the majority of our attendees come alone, so there's no need to worry about getting involved!",

Because we meet at the same time and place every week, many regulars do not sign up beforehand, but we always have a great turnout, often exceeding 40 people. We also have many more participants who join through other platforms.",
